title: Notes for coding for CS50 Course
---

Having CS50 course now! Taking some notes here about my struggling things on coding.

0.  The first home work is making a small game with visualized program platform from MIT, below is my work:  
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/712728725

1. In programing homework "substitution":
    Its important to remeber that a string is an array of chars:
    The following 2 lines:
    string text = "Hi!";
    printf("%i", text[0])
    will return the acsii code of H
    while the following one line:
    printf("%c", text[0])
    will print out the letter H.

2. When testting a program, I might need to type in several inputs repeatly. Here is the simple way to do it 'automatically':
    Create a txt file, named it as 'test.txt'.
    Typed in the input, one line one input, save it.
    When run a program, do it like this:
    ./program_name another_input_if_needed < test.txt
    then the program will take the input from text.txt when it prompts for the input.

3. Use the following code at the outside of main() to create a gloable const variable:
    'const int HEADER_SIZE = 44;'

4. Suprised by that fopen("fileaddress","open_method") function: If the file do not exist at the address, this function will create one; If the file arealdy exits, it erase the content of the file.

5. Use sizeof(int16_t) to get the length of the type of data, in %lu, which is unsigned long, here the answer is 2 (bytes);
    sizeof(char)   returns 1;
    sizeof(int)    returns 4;
    sizeof(float)  returns 4;
    sizeof(double) returns 8;
