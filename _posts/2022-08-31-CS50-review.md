title: Review for coding for CS50 Course
---

I almost finished my CS50 course except for the final project!  

Before I start my final project, I decide to take a deep review about what I have learned from this course. It will be a take-out for me for my furture study as well.  

## 1 Flask

- By using flask, the skills for managing the database(sqlite), editing webpage(html, css, javascript), and Python programming are connected.

## 2 Build the register function
1. To check if a input exists, use request.form.get("name_in_input_label"), if there is not a input, function returns false:
```python
        # Input a username:
        if not request.form.get("username"):
            return apology("must provide username", 400)
```

2. To hash the password, use `generate_password_hash(password, method='pbkdf2:sha256', salt_length=8)` from `werkzeug.security` library, check [here](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/utils/#werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash) for more information. And check the password with check_password_hash(hash_value, password).

## 3 Connecting app.py with html files in Flask
    1. in HTML page, you can use <form> to collect

## 4 Jinja
- Jinja is invovled here, but I used just the simplest funciton. For most situations I just passed in a list with dicts and let it be interpret by the lines like following:
```html
    {% for stock_inf in stock_inf_list %}
        <tr>
            <td class="text-start">{{ stock_inf['symbol'] }}</td>
            <td class="text-start">{{ stock_inf['name'] }}</td>
            <td class="text-end">{{ stock_inf['shares'] }}</td>
            <td class="text-end">{{ stock_inf['price'] }}</td>
            <td class="text-end">{{ stock_inf['cur_total'] }}</td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
```
will learn more if my final project needs.
